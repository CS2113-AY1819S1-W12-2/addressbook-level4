== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: added *the ability to export and import your contacts information.*
** What it does: Allows the user export contacts to a CSV file in any existing directory. Vice versa, CSV files can also be imported from any existing directory and be appended to the address book.
** Justification: Changing systems will be much easier as contact information can be packaged into an
easy to read format and exchanged between systems.
** Highlights: In order to ensure that the exported file can be read by other applications, CorpPro have to write the file in a way that it can be easily adapted by the other spreadsheet applications. +
When files are imported from other applications, in depth analysis have to be made to ensure that it can read the format of the file formatted by these spreadsheet applications.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added *the ability to back up and restore your address book.*
** What it does: Allow the user to back up their address book at any point in time. This allows them to revert their address book to any previous state if they wish to.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to retrieve any lost information if they have accidentally deleted any.
** Highlights: Careful planning has to be done as saving the folders in a separate directory will result in the database being easily accessible. Therefore, we have to protect the folder the backups are saved by making the directory unknown.
